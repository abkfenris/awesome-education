For resources, services, apps and domain specific tools that apply for those seeking to add extra letters around their name (B.A., PhD...) look under [higher learning](higher/).

Awesome things are broken up into __Learning__ and __Tools__.

__Learning__ includes courses, books, resources, and websites that have a good coverage of the subject. Both resources for teaching with and those for self learning may show up here. Preferably a little bit opinionated and structured so that one can use it to learn independently. References belong in tools. A tutorial for the use of a specific tool belongs under that tool.

__Tools__ contains services, apps, references, and specific tools that help learning whether it is happening in a classroom or independently.
