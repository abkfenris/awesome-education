# Contributing

We are always looking for contributions of what you find awesome or at least helpful for teaching and learning.

For those of you with experiance on GitHub jump right down to [Guidelines](#guidelines).

If you are new to GitHub, you can [sign up](https://github.com/join) and contribute directly to this repository.

The easiest way it to click edit on any page that you feel you have a worthwhile addition to. This will give you a text editor where you can edit the document directly. The documents are written in a format called [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/), and you can preview your changes in the browser. At the bottom it will give you an option to create it as a pull request, where you can describe your reasoning for making the change.

If you are unsure about where to make a change but still have a suggestion you can open an [Issue](https://github.com/abkfenris/awesome-education/issues/new) which will give us a place for discussion on how to make the change, or we could do it for you.

If all that is too much, feel free to email any suggestions to akerney@bridgtonacademy.org.

## Guidelines
- First figure out where it should go, what subject, and is it a learning resource or is it a tool? If you don't know then it is a great thing to create an [Issue](https://github.com/abkfenris/awesome-education/issues/new) for.
- Preferably one (top level) bullet per pull request.
- If there is a good tutorial for using a tool, a blog post describing how it is awesome for teaching or learning, or even just your blurb of words in support place that as a sub-bullet.
- Style:
  - [Service](http://servicewebsite.notreal) - _Cost if not obviously free_ __Platforms__ - Description
    - Supporting reasons/tutorials/blog posts
  - `- [Service](http://servicewebsite.notreal) - _Cost if not obviously free_ __Platforms__ - Description`
    - `- Supporting reasons/tutorials/blog posts`

  - A `-` will create a new bullet point. Make sure it has the same amount of spaces before it as the other bullets on the same level.
  - Start with the name of the resource, and link it to the website. You can do that by putting the name in square brackets and following it by the url in curly brackets `[]()`.
  - Follow with another `-` to delineate a change in type of information.
  - If the resource is not free, or may have some sort of gotchas (features not available to free users) mention that in italics, which can be made by surrounding the italicized text with `_`.
  - Platforms and type of resource. Mention the type of platforms that the resource runs on in bold which is surrounded by double `__`.
  - Another dash, then a description of the resource/service.
  - Finally if there are some awesome tutorials, blog posts, a quote, or other supporting materials include them as sub bullets. Just add two more spaces before the `-` as compared to the parent.
- Survived all that? Submit the pull request and share your awesome teaching and learning resource with the world.
